## Report - Crowdfunding Trend Analysis
### Conclusions

  •	Entertainment projects in “classic” media (theater overwhelmingly, followed by film & video, then music) – excluding games – are the most common cause that people crowdfund for. However, as with most other categories, only about half are successful (54%, 57%, and 56% respectively). There is more competition for people’s attention and money in these categories.

  •	Technology projects tend to be the most successful, at 67%. More specifically, web-based projects are more successful (71%) than wearables (62%).

  •	Campaigns tend to be the most successful in the late spring through early summer (May through June, and less successful from mid summer through winter, with the least success near the end of July/early August.

### Limitations

  •	The data does not include which campaigns offered incentives (backer rewards), which is obviously something to account for in the success of a campaign.

  •	Which campaigns offered stretch goals would also be something to consider, particularly to provide more insight on the campaigns that raised over 100% - did additional promises cause people to continue to support campaigns, or did support drop off when people felt like the campaign was “done”?

  •	A glaring omission is the fundraising platform used – we have no idea whether people have more success with Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc., or possible reasons why if so.

### Other Possibilities for Visualizing Data

  •	We could create a table that tracks average donation per country, or per category, filterable by the second factor. A clustered bar or column graph can visualize the data. This could tell us which countries and/org categories tend to draw larger donors, which can factor into location- or category- specific campaigns (do we cast a wide net or go after big fish?).
